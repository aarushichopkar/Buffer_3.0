Introduction
Hello, we’re Team Dead Souls. This is a project to help navigate through our college and find the shortest routes between two places.
This is what our interface looks like: -

Why do we need a navigation system for Cummins?
It’s difficult to find classrooms and labs when you first enter our campus as a student or a guest. We also realized that we normally use a longer route to reach some places where we could have used a shorter alternative if we had already known about its existence. This project helped us find some very interesting paths to take and now it’ll help you too.

Instructions: -
	The code is split into 3 java files. The ‘node’ file is used to store the buildings as vertices and creates a double dimensional arraylist of the rooms in that building, floor-wise.
	Class ‘map’ stores the main dijkstra’s algorithm to calculate the shortest distance and path.
	Class ‘MakeMap’ is used to create and store the graph.
	Frontend is created using Android Studio.
	A zip file of the android studio codes is attached with the project. Download and extract the zip files and you will be able to open it in your android studio software. 
	You can see the working of our app on an emulator.
	Do not set the phone on dark mode.
